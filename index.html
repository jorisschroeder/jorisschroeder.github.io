We argue that insufficient knowledge about heterogeneity in blood donor motivation limits our understanding of donor behaviour and the effectiveness of retention strategies. This study aims to identify types of blood and plasma donors based on factors that have been identified as central drivers of repeated blood donation behaviour, including constructs from an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour, prosocial values, and social network characteristics. We apply latent transition analysis to a large sample of blood and plasma donors in the Netherlands (N = 22,128). We identify four classes of donors: the moderately motivated donors (33%), the exceptionally motivated donors (18%), the unfulfilled donors (23%), and the confident habitual donors (26%). We identify socio-demographic predictors of class membership, show that donors often transition between these types over time, and that class membership is predictive of long-term donor lapse. Future research and blood bank marketeers would be advised to take donor heterogeneity into account when studying donors or designing campaigns for recruitment and retention of donors, as not all donors are alike.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="neumayr_how_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How perceived income inequality affects charitable giving and volunteering: assessing four mechanisms</div> <div class="author"> Michaela Neumayr and Joris Melchior Schröder </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>European Societies</em>, Jul 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/euso.a.22" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Public concerns about economic inequality are large and growing, and they have been shown to affect people’s charitable giving and volunteering. While empirical literature addresses this issue, it provides little evidence on the underlying mechanisms linking inequality and civic engagement. Scholars from different disciplines have proposed numerous hypotheses about these mechanisms, with the social disintegration, conflict, relative power, and unmet needs hypotheses among the most frequently suggested. In this study, we apply mediation analysis to survey data from Austria and Germany (N = 1,691) to assess which of these mechanisms help explain the relationship. Our results support the social disintegration and unmet needs hypotheses: individuals who completely agree that income inequality is too high are slightly less likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through generalised social trust and substantially more likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through impure altruism compared to those who completely disagree that income inequality is too high. These findings imply that multiple mechanisms work in opposing directions. Our study provides an important step in theory development in this field and serves as a basis for future experimental studies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ciausescu_building_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Building awareness: Introducing education about blood-product donation in the school curriculum</div> <div class="author"> Alexandra Ciaușescu, Joris Melchior Schröder, Louisanne Hooff, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

But why do some people repeatedly engage in such prosocial behaviour, especially when it is costly to themselves? This study examines to what extent social contagion within neighbourhoods – changing behaviour in response to the behaviour of others – affects repeated blood donation behaviour. We draw on longitudinal survey and register data from a representative sample of blood donors in the Netherlands from 2007 to 2014 (N = 15,090). Using a panel data model and an instrumental variable approach, we find that donors are positively affected by donations made by other donors living in their neighbourhood. This effect does not seem to be mediated by normative or informational social influence. Exploratory analysis further attributes this finding to social contagion within donor couples. Our study contributes to the literature on repeated blood donation behaviour, and can inform retention strategies of blood banks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schroder_how_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How socio-economic inequality affects individuals’ civic engagement: a systematic literature review of empirical findings and theoretical explanations</div> <div class="author"> Joris Melchior Schröder and Michaela Neumayr </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Socio-Economic Review</em>, Jan 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwab058" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Rising socio-economic inequality in many countries raises the question of how it affects individuals’ civic engagement in the forms of charitable giving, volunteering and non-profit membership. Though a growing body of multidisciplinary literature has started to address this issue, empirical results vary considerably and explanations about what underlies this relationship remain fragmentary. We thus conduct a systematic literature review to (a) provide a synopsis of empirical findings and (b) identify theoretical explanations and presumed mediating mechanisms underlying this relationship. Reviewing 70 studies, we find that higher inequality is most often negatively related to civic engagement, and that this relation is moderated by individual factors, for example, income and education. Furthermore, we map the proposed theoretical explanations into five key approaches. For each of these, we trace and identify the underlying mechanisms at both the societal and the individual level, and provide a conceptual framework that facilitates their empirical analysis in future.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schroder_did_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Did you donate?

They are facilitated by organizations that broker between donors and recipients. A highly effective tool that organizations use to elicit prosocial behaviour are solicitations for donations (e.g., of blood, time, or money). Using register and survey data on blood donations in the Netherlands, we examine to what extent compliance with these solicitations is predicted by being recruited via word of mouth (WOM) and talking about donations. Our model predicts that donors that are one unit higher on our measure of talking about donations (range = 1–4) have a 2.9 percentage points higher compliance with solicitations for donations. In addition, this association is stronger for novice donors. Our study demonstrates the social embedding of the donors’ decision-making processes about compliance. For practice, our results imply that organizations may increase their contributors’ communication about donations to increase the effectiveness of their solicitations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="landesmann_agglomeration_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Agglomeration of European Industries</div> <div class="author"> Michael A.

This period was characterized by the development of potent cross-border regional production networks in manufacturing in Central Europe that include both the more advanced regions of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Northern Italy, Sweden, and those of the new EU member states of Central and Eastern Europe. These developments were accompanied by serious deindustrialization processes in other parts of Europe which in turn had important macroeconomic implications in the form of sustained external imbalances. The chapter explores the geographic agglomeration of industrial activity in Europe, but also that of ‘advanced tradable services’ in which the more advanced regions of Europe can counter balance the loss of manufacturing. It also gives evidence of cross-border (vertical and functional) specialization patterns that characterize regional production networks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6A%6F%72%69%73.%73%63%68%72%6F%65%64%65%72@%6E%6F%74%74%69%6E%67%68%61%6D.%61%63.%75%6B" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6207-0990" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://osf.io/476jm/" title="Open Science Framework" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-osf"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a3AXzO0AAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Joris M.
